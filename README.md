# Superstore-Tableau-Project

## Scenario

You work for Superstore, a large furniture, office supplies, and technology store in the US. You will support the Regional Manager to create a best practice sales report dashboard.

## Sales Report Dashboard

Here is a link to my sales report dashboard [link](https://public.tableau.com/shared/PNB4F5H9X?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link&:device=desktop). In this dashboard I put the total sales, total profit, total quantity, and a chart with the sales over a 4 year period. Also you can use the dashboard to filter by each state in the United States.

## Data Exploration Dashboard

My regional manager has reviewed my sales report dashboard and he has raised questions about why certain states have negative profit. They want me to develop an data exploration dashboard to see why these states are doing worst than others. 

Here is a link to my data exploration dashboard [link](https://public.tableau.com/shared/JX9X8WMG2?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link&:device=desktop). In this dashboard I put in a chart that shows the profit of each product sold, a map with the state profit, a chart to show the profit over the last 4 years, and a scatter plot to see the correlation between sales and profits. 

## Data Story

After reviewing my data exploration dashboard they discovered that although Pennsylvania is one of the biggest markets for Superstore in terms of sales, Pennsylvania is still creating a negative profit. My regional manager believe the way to solve this issue is to build a distribution center in Philadelphia to lower distribution cost. My regional manager wants me to make a tableau data story to help argue for the creation of a distribution center near Philadelphia. My regional manager wants me to highlight the following arguments in my data story:

*Pennsylvania is one of Superstore's biggest markets by sales
*But many orders there result in negative profit
*Cost of sale scales with the value of the sale
*Could be resolved with a new distribution center near Philadelphia, the main sales hub in the state
*We see positive profits in Washington, New York, and California, but a similar story in Texas
*However, the spread of sales in Texas means that a new distribution center in Texas may not achieve as great a shift in the cost of sales
